**Emoji Morpher**

It uses weighted randomness to generate new emojis.
We can mix emotions to our liking for the emoji.
emojis have separate randomness for facial features (eyes,mouth,eyebrows), so we can end up with unique combinations of emojis in every click. 

Text can be either randomized or be given from input
